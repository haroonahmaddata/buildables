Are most people in China and Russia just living regular lives?
Being American, you’re taught most of your life that China and Russia are dictatorships where the people could never hope to live the life the average person in the US lives.

Now, watching the US devolve into an autocracy while my day to day life really doesn’t change it all, it’s made me wonder if the average random person in these countries is living the same relatively comfortable, happy life I am.

Edit: did not expect this to blow up so much. I have traveled quite a bit, but mostly in Europe. 
I'm well aware of the American narrative of Universal Healthcare=Socialism=Bad and have spent countless hours debating that with friends and family. 
I guess I just haven't had to think too much about autocracies because my comparison of the US to other countries has always been what I hoped we could become, but now I'm having to compare in the context of what we are becoming.
