# Large Language Model Reasoning Evaluation

This repository contains the results and justification for an evaluation of a Large Language Model's reasoning capabilities across different task types and prompting methods. The goal of this analysis is to determine the most effective method for generating accurate, clear, and complete responses.

## 1. Evaluation Results

The following table presents the raw scores for each task and prompt type, based on a comprehensive scoring rubric.

| Task | Prompt Type | Correctness | Clarity | Completeness | Conciseness | Total Score |
| :--- | :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Logic | Zero-Shot | 3 | 0 | 1 | 3 | 7 |
| Logic | Few-Shot | 3 | 0 | 1 | 3 | 7 |
| Logic | CoT | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 12 |
| Math | Zero-Shot | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 12 |
| Math | Few-Shot | 3 | 0 | 1 | 3 | 7 |
| Math | CoT | 3 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 9 |

## 2. Justification of Results

The scores are based on a rubric that evaluates four key criteria:

*   **Correctness (Score: 3):** All responses were factually correct and solved the problem as intended, so all received a perfect score.

*   **Clarity (Score: 0, 2, or 3):** This score measures how well the reasoning is explained.
    *   **Zero-Shot and Few-Shot** prompts scored **0** because they provided only the final answer without any explanation.
    *   **Math CoT** scored a **2** because its explanation was good but lacked a structured breakdown.
    *   **Logic CoT and Math Zero-Shot** both scored a perfect **3**, thanks to their detailed, step-by-step reasoning.

*   **Completeness (Score: 1, 2, or 3):** This measures whether the full solution is explained.
    *   **Zero-Shot and Few-Shot** scored a **1** as they were incomplete, only providing the final answer.
    *   **Math CoT** scored a **2**, offering core reasoning but without a full, comprehensive breakdown.
    *   **Logic CoT and Math Zero-Shot** both scored a **3**, providing a complete solution with full reasoning and steps.

*   **Conciseness (Score: 2 or 3):** This score measures how brief and to the point the response is.
    *   All responses except **Math CoT** scored a **3**. The short answers were perfectly concise, while the detailed explanations were efficient for their purpose.
    *   **Math CoT** scored a **2**, as its explanation was slightly less structured and more conversational.

## 3. Key Takeaways

*   The evaluation highlights that a successful response is not just about a correct answer, but about the **quality of the explanation**.
*   **Zero-Shot and Few-Shot** prompting methods, which produce short answers, scored a **7**. While correct and concise, they lacked the clarity and completeness necessary for top performance.
*   **Chain-of-Thought (CoT)** prompting methods performed the best, demonstrating the value of a step-by-step reasoning process. **Logic CoT** and **Math Zero-Shot** (which implicitly used a detailed reasoning process) achieved a perfect **12**.
*   The **Math CoT** response, while good, shows that a less structured explanation can still impact the overall score.
