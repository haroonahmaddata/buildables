# Analysis of LLM Outputs by Temperature Setting

## 1. Summary Output Comparison

| Temperature Setting | Summary Length (Words) | Key Characteristics & Observations |
| :----------------- | :-------------------: | :--- |
| **0.1 (Low)** | 235 | **Most Factual & Concise:** The summary is brief, direct, and sticks closely to the factual claims in the source text. It presents the core information (the deal, the trend, the criticism) with minimal elaboration or flourish. The language is neutral and objective. |
| **0.7 (Medium)** | 387 | **More Detailed & Contextual:** This summary is significantly longer and incorporates more specific examples and details from the article (e.g., mentioning South Sudan, Nauru, the EU-Turkey deal). It begins to use slightly more evocative language ("sparked outrage," "exploitative") while still remaining largely factual. It provides a more comprehensive overview. |
| **1.0 (High)** | 441 | **Broadest Scope & Interpretive:** The longest summary, it attempts to synthesize the broader geopolitical implications ("geopolitical pressures," "tensions"). The language is more interpretive and less strictly tied to the source's phrasing. It introduces concepts like "outsourcing migration issues" as a framing device, showing a higher level of abstraction from the original text. |

### Summary Conclusion
As the temperature increases, the summaries become:
- Longer and more detailed
- Less strictly factual, incorporating more interpretation and broader contextual framing
- Slightly more emotive in their word choice

The low-temperature (0.1) output is the most faithful and concise retelling, while the high-temperature (1.0) output provides a more expansive, interpreted summary of the article's themes.

## 2. Q&A Output Comparison

### Question 1: "What the article is about?"

| Temperature | Answer Length & Style | Key Observations |
| :---------- | :----------- | :--------------- |
| **0.1** | Concise (1 paragraph) | **Direct and Factual:** Focuses strictly on the core concept: wealthy nations paying developing ones to accept migrants. Lists key actors (US, AU, EU) and the main criticisms (ethical concerns, human rights). Very little fluff or interpretation. |
| **0.7** | Detailed (1 paragraph) | **Expanded and Contextual:** Includes more specifics, framing the practice as a "lucrative business." It broadens the scope to mention "legal" concerns alongside ethical ones and explicitly names the perception of Africa as a "dumping ground." |
| **1.0** | Broad (1 paragraph) | **Interpretive and Synthetic:** Uses higher-level framing like "outsourcing migration management" and "geopolitical pressures." It focuses more on the overarching tensions and controversies rather than listing specific factual examples from the text. |

### Question 2: "What the US did in the article?"

| Temperature | Answer Length & Style | Key Observations |
| :---------- | :----------- | :--------------- |
| **0.1** | Structured and factual (4 bullet points) | **Systematic Breakdown:** Provides a clear, organized list of US actions (deportation, compensation, controversies, int'l responses). It is the most structured and easily scannable answer, offering specific examples like the $100k payment. |
| **0.7** | Narrative and detailed (4 paragraphs) | **Comprehensive Narrative:** Weaves the facts into a more prose-like explanation. It covers the same ground as T=0.1 but with more connective tissue, explaining the "why" (Trump's strategy) and the consequences (strain on relations) in greater detail. |
| **1.0** | Concise narrative (1 paragraph) | **Summarized with Key Themes:** Condenses the US actions into a brief overview, hitting the main points (deporting, paying, pressuring) and immediately connecting them to the larger criticisms and outcomes (perception of a "dumping ground," Nigerian refusal). |

### Question 3: "Tell me about the crux of the article in 2 lines?"

| Temperature | Answer Characteristics | Key Observations |
| :---------- | :--------------------- | :--------------- |
| **0.1** | Precise and Neutral | Perfectly captures the two main components: the action (outsourcing migrants) and the criticism (ethical concerns). The language is clean, neutral, and meets the "2 lines" request exactly. |
| **0.7** | Detailed and Emphatic | Uses stronger, more critical language ("exploitation," "coerced agreements," "dire conditions"). It adds a layer of emotional weight and consequence that is absent from the T=0.1 response, exceeding the "2 lines" brief. |
| **1.0** | Thematic and General | Focuses on the high-level themes of "controversy," "resistance," and "complexities." It is less about the specific action of paying countries and more about the resulting geopolitical and ethical debates. |

## 3. Overall Q&A Behavior Conclusion

**Temperature = 0.1 (Low):** Produces the most factual, concise, and structured answers. It acts like a precise summarizer, sticking closely to the source material with minimal interpretation. Answers are often bulleted for clarity.

**Temperature = 0.7 (Medium):** Generates more detailed, narrative-driven, and contextual answers. It begins to interpret the facts, use more evocative language, and provide explanations for the events described. It balances fact with mild elaboration.

**Temperature = 1.0 (High):** Yields the most interpretive and thematic answers. It focuses on synthesizing the broader implications ("geopolitical pressures," "complexities") and is more likely to use abstract framing. It prioritizes the "big picture" over specific details.
